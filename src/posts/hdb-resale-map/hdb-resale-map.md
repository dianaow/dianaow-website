## Overview

This interactive visualization tool provides an intuitive way to explore Singapore's HDB (Housing & Development Board) property market. By combining historical resale transaction data with geographical information, users can gain valuable insights into property trends across different neighborhoods and time periods.

The application features a dynamic timeline interface that allows users to:
- Track property price changes over time
- Compare prices across different towns and streets
- Filter properties by completion year, flat type, and location
- Visualize property attributes such as price distributions through color-coded maps

## Architecture

Raw data was pulled from the multiple API endpoints from Singapore's open data portal: data.gov.sg. The Flask backend performs some data processing and transformation and sends this to the frontend which is built with React and Mapbox.

Key components:
- **Data Collection**: Automated data extraction from data.gov.sg APIs
- **Data Processing**: Flask backend for data aggregation and transformation
- **Data Visualization**: React frontend with Mapbox integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel platform with automated cron jobs

## Backend

The Flask backend serves as the data processing layer, handling several key responsibilities:

Data Integration:
- Fetches data from multiple data.gov.sg endpoints
- Processes property information, resale transactions, and geographical boundaries
- Geocoding properties using OneMap API

Data Processing:
- Aggregates resale prices by location and time period
- Generates optimized data structures for frontend consumption

API Endpoints:
- RESTful endpoints for data retrieval

## Frontend

The map interface serves as the central component of the application. Using Mapbox GL JS, I created a custom map visualization that displays all HDB properties across Singapore. I styled the basemap within Mapbox Studio. The map features a circle marker layer with properties color-coded based on various attributes such as price range, age and property types. The map's pitch (tilt) can be adjusted, and the marker layer can be swapped for a clustered property count layer.

  <img

    src={clustering_img}
    fetchpriority="high"
    alt="Placeholder Image"
  />
</div>  
<br>

The chart view offers an alternative perspective on price trends across and within towns. Built with D3.js, it dynamically highlights corresponding map locations when users interact with data points. Clicking a map marker highlights the related dots on the chart. Custom event handlers in React ensure seamless synchronization between the chart and map views.

<div class="video-container" data-src={features}>
  <img
    id="placeholder_image"
    src={features_img}
    fetchpriority="high"
    alt="Placeholder Image"
  />
</div>  
<br>


The filtering system allows users to narrow down their search based on multiple criteria. The filters include dropdown menus for property types, completion years, and location-based selections.

<br>
<div class="video-container" data-src={features2}>
  <img
    id="placeholder_image"
    src={features2_img}
    fetchpriority="high"
    alt="Placeholder Image"
  />
</div>  
<br>


The legend system provides context for the color-coded visualizations. I created a custom legend component that updates dynamically based on the current view and selected filters. Each legend element is interactive and allow users to toggle specific data categories on and off.

<br>
<div class="video-container" data-src={legend}>
  <img
    id="placeholder_image"
    src={legend_img}
    fetchpriority="high"
    alt="Placeholder Image"
  />
</div>  
<br>

## Insights

The visualization reveals several notable trends in Singaporeâ€™s HDB resale market:

*Price Evolution Over Time:* Resale prices have generally increased, with distinct periods of growth and stabilization.Resale prices experienced a significant uptick since 2020.

*Emergence of Million-Dollar HDB Flats:* The data highlights HDB resale flats transacting at or above S$1 million. Mature estates such as Toa Payoh, Kallang/Whampoa and Bukit Merah are notable for their significant number of high-value transactions.

*Neighborhood Price Variations:* Prime locations such as the Central and Queenstown regions exhibit consistently higher resale values, whereas areas further from the city center, like Woodlands and Jurong, remain more affordable.

*Price Variations Within Towns:* Towns such as Central Area, Queenstown and Toa Payoh exhibit significant internal price disparities, possibly due to the mix of older and newer flats within.

*Impact of Completion Year:* Flats completed in the last two decades tend to fetch higher resale prices, but some older estates such as Queenstown retain strong value as it is a prime location with proximity to amenities and the city center.
